# python-problems-and-solutions
Hi, here's a beginner for python! The aim of creating this repository is to summarize all the problems i met and their solutions, and some ideas beyond them. Here thanks to CSDN and others who gives even a little help to improve my code. Also, welcome to offer any suggestions and I'm looking forward you comments!
